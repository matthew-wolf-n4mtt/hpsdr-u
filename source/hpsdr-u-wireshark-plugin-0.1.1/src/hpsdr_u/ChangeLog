Version 0.1.0:

  - Wireshark version 2.0.1 
  - There is no disassembly of status 3 datagrams. Status 3 is used to
    manually set the SDR's IP address and program the SDR's firmware.
  - There is no disassembly of USB end point 4 datagrams. USB end point 4 
    is used for sending raw ADC (Wide Band-scope) samples to the HOST. The 
    Wide Band-scope bit in the Start / Stop Command is disassembled. 

Version: 0.1.1

* Intial Public Version

 - While waiting for SVN access I started to work on a plug-in for the 
   openHPSDR Ethernet Protocol. Both the USB over IP and the Ethernet protocol
   use UDP port 1024. This means that the two plug-ins have to coexist with 
   each other.
 - Changed the plug-in to registering as heuristic dissector. The plug-in tests 
   the first two bytes of the UDP payload for the 0xEFFE id. Then it does not 
   see the ID it exits. 
 - I do not forsee any more updates until I finish the plug-in for the 
   openHPSDR Ethernet Protocol.
