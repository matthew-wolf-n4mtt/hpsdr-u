Version 0.3.0 was developed with Wireshark 3.0.1.

I assuming that that build environment for Wireshark has all ready been
created.

1. Compile the Plug-in
----------------------

There are two ways to compile the plug-in. Outside or inside the 
Wireshark source tree.


  A. Build the Plug-in Out Side of the Wireshark Source Tree
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  You will need to have the Wireshark development libraries installed.

  1. Unpack the plug-in source file somewhere.

  2. Enter the plug-in source directory.

   cd openhpsdr-u

  3. Create the build directory.

    cd <Wireshark Source Root>
    mkdir build

  4. Enter the Build directory and run cmake.

    cd build
    cmake .. 

  6. Run make to build the plug-in.

    cd <Plug-in Source Root>/build
    make <Your Favorite Options>

  7. Install the plug-in.

    sudo make install

  I used the <Wireshark 3.0.1>/doc/plugins.example/README as reference.

  B. Build the Plug-in in the Wireshark Source Tree
  ----------------------------------------------

  You need the Wireshark sources to compile the plug-in in the 
  Wireshark source tree. It is best to compile Wireshark before compiling the 
  plug-in. Compiling Wireshark will validate that you have all libraries needed
  to compile the plug-in.

  1. Unpack the plug-in source file somewhere.

  2. Copy and or move the "openhpsdr-u" directory from the plug-in source
     into the Wireshark source tree.
     A. Copy or move the "openhpsdr-u" into
        <Wireshark Source Root>/plugins/epan 

  3. Add the plug-in to root CMakeLists.txt file.
     A. Add the plug-in directory to the PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS set.

  if(ENABLE_PLUGINS)
          ...
          set(PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS
                  ...
                  plugins/unistim
                  plugins/wimax
                  plugins/wimaxasncp
                  plugins/wimaxmacphy
                  plugins/openhpsdr-u
                  ${CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR}
          )

  Add "plugins/openhpsdr-u" to the end of the list. An example is above.

  4.Create the build directory.

    cd <Wireshark Source Root>
    mkdir build

  5. Enter the Build directory and run cmake.

    cd build
    cmake ..

  6. Run make to build Wireshark and the plug-in.

   cd <Wireshark Source Root>/build
   make <Your Favorite Options>

  7. Install Wireshark and the plug-in.

    sudo make install
